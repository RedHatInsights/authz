# Domain/contract package

Place for domain contracts for the interfaces implemented in package Infrastructure. 

Currenty:
- Config (not satisfied with this one)
- AuthzEngine (no domain service so far)
- Server (decouples the server and router from the domain. may evolve into 2 contracts, server and router)
