  // OPERATION 1: Entitle an organizatin.
  // to entitle, create license tuples for the max, the current version, and the seats.
  // the license resorce ID is in the format {org ID}/{service ID}
  license:o1/smarts#max@max:10

  // a version is in the format {random_id}/{current_assigned_user_count}.
  // this is so we can quickly read the number of users.
  // every update must update the version and keep the current count consistent.
  // This is commented out because the later example updates the version.
  // license:o1/smarts#version@version:0DCB176B/0
  // write a separate seats relation, so that users can be put in a separate type.
  // this lets us look up the license info quickly, without ALSO looking up all the users.
  // this uses the same resource ID as the license, because they are effectively a part of the same entity.
  license:o1/smarts#seats@license_seats:o1/smarts

  // OPERATION 2: Assign a user
  // 1. read the existing license entity based on org ID & servce ID
  // 2. check current assigned (found in version relation) < max (found in max relation)
  // 3. if not, return error
  // 4. otherwise, add user relation to seats, update version of license, and remove existing version,
  // IFF there exists a version relation matching the current (OPERATION_MUST_MATCH precondition)
